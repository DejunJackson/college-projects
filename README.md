# college-projects

Found some old Java projects that I wrote for some classes during my Undergraduate program. All of them can successfully be compiled as far as I know.

# Set Up
1. Clone repository
2. Navigate to the directory where repository is kept in command prompt or other terminal
3. To compile a project ```javac <project name>.java```
4. Once successfully compiled ```java <project name>``` to compile

**NOTE**: Make sure Java is properly installed on your machine with ```java -version``` and ```javac -version``` in terminal. If not, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ-PJbvJBGs) can help with installation.
